## Overview

This project aims to develop a recommendation system using various algorithms and techniques. The goal is to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behaviors. This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that detail the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.


## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following steps:

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ezekiel1991/Group-8-Phase-4-Project--Recommendation-Systems.git
   cd Group-8-Phase-4-Project--Recommendation-Systems
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the desired notebook (e.g., `Group_8_Phase_4_Project.ipynb`) and run the cells to see the results.
## PROJECT OBJECTIVES.
* Personalized movie recommendations based on the user’s history
* Investigate how the system performs for new users and new movies (analysis of the cold start problem)
* Build a deep learning-based model that learns from user ratings and movie features to improve recommendation accuracy
* Optimize recommendation algorithms
* A dashboard to explore recommendations and engagement insights.


## Project Structure



- `Group_8_Phase_4_Project.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the recommendation system implementation.


## EDA

* We performed various data cleaning processes and pre processing for our ML models.
* We also merged our datasets into one unified dataset and named it movie_data.
* we also performed visualization and these were some:

## Algorithms Used

This project explores various recommendation algorithms, including but not limited to:

- KNN
- SVD
- Collaborative Filtering
- Content-Based Filtering
- Hybrid Methods




## Recommendations
* **DATA** - Handling New Users – The system ensures that even new users get relevant movie suggestions, helping them discover great content quickly.
- Keeping Recommendations Fresh – Over time, people’s tastes change. The system adapts by considering recent trends and viewing habits.
- Reducing Information Overload – With thousands of movies available, users often struggle with choice paralysis. Your system simplifies decision-making.
- Supporting Industry Growth – By surfacing lesser-known films and niche content, it helps smaller filmmakers reach their audience.
- Adapting to Changing Trends – The system recognizes popular movie trends and adjusts recommendations accordingly, staying relevant.
- Potential for Business Expansion – Beyond movies, the approach can be applied to recommending books, music, or even shopping items—showing its broader impact.





## Conclusions

- The initial analysis and implementation of the recommendation system have shown promising results, particularly with the hybrid model.
- Preprocessing steps were crucial in preparing the data, reducing noise, and improving accuracy.
- Future iterations should focus on incorporating diverse data sources and refining algorithms.
- This project has been a solid foundation for developing a sophisticated recommendation system with the potential to enhance user experience.
